## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs 
LAB 3 part-1
Lab three was very interesting to me because its something that's important to know in the real world. I love working out and knowing what my bmr is. It was our Second time using std::cout and std::cin; and our first time declaring doubles! .This lab pushed me to try my best and push my knowledge for a better understanding. 

Lab 9 part-2 
The reason why I chose lab 3 to be the second lab to be featured on the favorite labs section is simply because of my childhood. Games (video games in particular) have always been in my life since the age of 4. So creating “my first game” in class brought me nostalgia. Although it was a simple game, it was a struggle to program at first. This program introduced us to std::ifstream. 

Lab 10 part-1

Last but not least lab 10. This lab holds a very special place in my heart, because it was the first solo lab that I've EVER done. A couple hours after this lab was made available, I had surgery on my leg. This lab introduced us to 2D vectors and how to utilize them in our code and I did just that. It also taught me the counties we have in this very lovely state of ours California. 58!
